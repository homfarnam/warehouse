#  WareHouse Front-end


 
This app is a project that it's working with a warehouse API that it provided by a Node js local server with some data.

### Tests

For the unit tests, I used react testing library and jest to test some components and hooks and api to make sure that the app is working correctly and there is no issues with that.
I used jest to mock axios and my custom axios interceptor that it customized for this specific project that it can handle a unreliable API.
